    <P>I went to avery elementry school K-5 and really ennjoyed it and all my teachers. I think that my Fitfth grade year was my favorite because we were the oldest kids at the school. My least favorite year was kindergarden, because we had alot more rules and did't get to go on any fun feild trips.</P>
                <h1>Middle School</h1>
    <p>I went to Steger Middle school and did not enjoy it at all. I think it was because I did't know anyone on my team and got split from my friends. On the other hand all my friends got put on the same team and loved it.</p>
            <h1>Hixson Middle</h1>
    <p>In Hixson I loved it and had classes and lunch with all my friends. Also all my teachers were great both years.</p>
